*Various examples of tests I do on a daily basis before implementing golang.*

**NOTE:** The examples below are for educational use only, to practice and test various possibilities of golang implementations.

Before developing projects in golang I do several unit tests and I am making my tests and examples available to the community, and maybe I can help you.

It was one of the ways I found to know a little more language.

I hope they help you.
